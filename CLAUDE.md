## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Build & Test

The gate. **Judge it by the exit code and nothing else** — a fully green run has
previously ended with a line reading `failed command: .../test --listen=-`.

```sh
zig build test > /tmp/t.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"
```

Then read the verdict block, which the run prints last. Two fields in it are
load-bearing:

- **`source root:`** must name the worktree you edited. On 2026-08-12 a
  subagent's build silently ran in a sibling worktree; the exit code was real
  and described someone else's code, and nothing else in the output said so.
  Confirm `pwd` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before treating any exit
  code as evidence.
- **`PASS, INCOMPLETE`** means `src/providers/phux/` was not in the build at
  all, because the phux client FFI was not found. The rest of the run is real;
  a change under that directory is not verified by it.

No verdict block at all means the run was not green, whatever else printed.

`-Dphux-enabled=true` swaps the *app* graph onto the phux provider. It is **not**
what compiles `src/providers/phux/` — FFI discovery is, and the flag alone never
was sufficient. Zig analyzes only what is referenced and nothing in Cockpit calls
`PhuxProvider.search`, so a 2026-08-10 signature drift passed at exit 0 under
every invocation including the full phux one. `src/providers/phux/ref.zig` plus a
`refAllDeclsRecursive` test in each rooted module is what forces the analysis.

README.md, "Reading the result of `zig build test`", has the FFI search order.

### Running it

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: scripts/dev-run.sh was in flight on 2026-08-12 and is the
     answer to "how do I run this". Replace this block with its invocation
     once it lands, rather than guessing its flags here. -->

Whatever you run, check what binary a bug report is actually about. On
2026-08-12 `/Applications` held 0.7.1 built three days earlier while `main` was
0.8.0, so nothing merged in those three days had ever been in front of the
person filing render bugs.

### The other entry points

| Script | Answers |
|---|---|
| `scripts/automate-smoke.sh` | does the real bundle come up, present through the packet path, and respond to driven input? |
| `scripts/drive-shell-ceiling.sh --want N` | how many concurrent shells does the shipped bundle actually reach before one is refused? |
| `scripts/host-raster-check.sh` | does the host's real CoreText rasterizer still ink glyphs as thickly as the pinned baseline? |
| `scripts/host-raster-compare.sh <ref>` | did an SDK change move glyph pixels between two commits that both shipped? |
| `scripts/check-sdk-pin.sh` | does README name the sha `build.zig.zon` actually resolves? |
| `scripts/build-automation-cli.sh` | builds the only `native` CLI that can drive this app; the npm one is fingerprint-refused and always will be. |

## Architecture Overview

A Zig macOS app on the Native SDK fork
[`phall1/native`](https://github.com/phall1/native), pinned in `build.zig.zon`
by tarball sha. Cockpit is that fork's only real consumer, which is why breakage
arrives all at once at a pin bump — docs/SDK_PIN.md has the pre-bump checklist.

- `src/cockpit/` — model, update, topology, layout, session state.
  `src/cockpit/native/` is the host/scene/view boundary.
- `src/providers/` — `contract.zig` holds provider-neutral identity; `local/`
  runs PTYs in-process, `phux/` reaches a remote phux across an FFI ABI.
- `src/terminal/` — one `libghostty-vt` session per terminal, projected into a
  canvas grid. The emulator owns cell state, damage, scrollback and selection.
- `src/config/`, `src/tests/`.

Three invariants that shape most changes:

- **Identity is provider-backed.** Tab, pane, window, PID and effect-key
  position are never durable identity.
- **One geometry.** `layout.resolve()` is the single source of pane rects for
  the painter, the hit-test widget tree and the PTY sizing pump. They were three
  independent derivations once, and had already drifted.
- **Two rasterizers.** On glass the AppKit host decodes the packet path and
  draws with CoreText. `native automate screenshot` runs a pure-Zig CPU
  reference renderer that never calls CoreText. Only one of them is on screen.

## Conventions & Patterns

**An assertion you have not seen fail is not evidence.** Assert absent, act,
assert present. A merged and publicly retracted "automation input is broken"
finding came from an assertion that could not move: it counted
`role=textbox name="Terminal`, which only ever matches the SELECTED tab, so a
new tab could not shift it however perfectly the key was delivered. The
`expect_change` helper in `scripts/automate-smoke.sh` encodes the shape. Give
any assertion you add its before-half too.

**Never compare against a counterfactual you authored.** The font-smoothing fix
was validated by hand-editing the SDK into a state no build was ever in; against
the real prior commit it moves zero pixels. Compare two things that shipped —
`scripts/host-raster-compare.sh` exists for exactly this.

**A screenshot cannot answer a glyph question.** The automation screenshot path
is structurally blind to everything CoreText does: outlines, hinting, smoothing,
CG blend arithmetic, device colour space. Never conclude "the text renders
correctly" from one. Read docs/RENDER_FIDELITY.md before writing any test that
claims to check what the terminal looks like.

**Live-app automation is serial-only** (`phux-cockpit-2ml.10`). The automation
dropbox is per-user rather than per-process and activation targets a process by
NAME, so a second bundle silently steals the channel, and a snapshot of a dead
instance returns an empty widget tree instead of an error. Assert
`publisher_pid` is the pid you launched before believing anything. Guard with
`pgrep -x <exename>` or `pgrep -f "[p]attern"`; plain `pgrep -f` matches the
shell running it, which is fatal inside a wait loop and quietly wrong outside
one.

**Measure constants, never pick them**, and keep the deriving command beside the
number — `--min-solid 4000` and the 32-shell pty ceiling both carry theirs.

**Show every regression test failing first.** Disable the fix, watch red,
restore, watch green, and report what you disabled.

Settled questions live in docs/DECISIONS.md; reopen one by adding information,
not by re-litigating it. Track work with `bd` and keep durable knowledge in
`bd remember`. No emoji in committed files. This codebase writes substantial WHY
comments rather than restating code — match that density.

**AGENTS.md and this file are independent**, not symlinked, and they have
already drifted: AGENTS.md carried the product contract, the rendering-evidence
warning and the test gate while this file was still scaffold placeholders.
AGENTS.md remains the product contract and quality bar; this file is the build,
the map and the working rules. Mirror substantive changes into both.
