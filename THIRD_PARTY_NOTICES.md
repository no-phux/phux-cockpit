## JetBrains Mono Nerd Font

Phux Cockpit embeds `JetBrainsMonoNL Nerd Font Mono` from Nerd Fonts v3.4.0 in
four weights — Regular, Bold, Italic, and BoldItalic — so that SGR bold and
italic select a real face rather than a synthesized one, and so that a bold
prompt keeps the same Nerd Font glyph coverage as a regular one. The patched
font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. The complete
copyright notice and license are distributed beside this file as
`JetBrainsMono-OFL.txt`.

JetBrains Mono copyright 2020 The JetBrains Mono Project Authors.
Nerd Fonts font patches copyright 2014 Ryan L McIntyre.
