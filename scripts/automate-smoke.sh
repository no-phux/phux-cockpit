# for readiness, and drives it.
#
# WHY EVERY ASSERTION HERE HAS A NEGATIVE CONTROL
# ------------------------------------------------
# `expect_change` asserts the pattern is ABSENT, performs the action, then
# asserts it is PRESENT. The absent half is not ceremony — it is the only
# thing standing between this script and the failure that produced it.
#
# On 2026-08-12 an earlier version of this file carried a confident warning
# that automation input was silently broken. It was not. The assertion used to
# "prove" it counted `role=textbox name="Terminal`, which only ever matches the
# SELECTED tab's rendered pane — so `cmd+t` creating a second TAB could not
# move it, no matter how perfectly the key was delivered. The harness was
# telling the truth; the assertion could not fail for the right reason, and so
# it manufactured a finding. See phux-cockpit-2ml.5.
#
# An assertion never seen to distinguish the two states is not evidence.
# If you add one here, give it its before-half too.
#
# Verified observables for this app (2026-08-12, against the real bundle):
#   new tab            role=tab name="Terminal N
#   rendered pane      role=textbox name="Terminal        (SELECTED tab only)
#   scrollback search  role=group name="Scrollback search
# measures: real-bundle structure, interaction, fullscreen, scheduler cadence, steady repaint, and split/close churn
#
# SERIAL ONLY (phux-cockpit-2ml.10). The identity-staged measurement bundles
# deliberately reuse dev-run's `phux-cockpit-dev` process identity, so two live
# measurement runs would make PID activation ambiguous even though each has a
# private dropbox. scripts/lib/app-instance.sh refuses that state and keeps
# checking the exact process and publisher PID between driven steps; the swap
# that filed the bead happened in the MIDDLE of a sequence that started clean.
