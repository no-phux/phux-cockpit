# Does the minimum-contrast floor change what reaches the GLASS, and by how
# much?
#
#   ./scripts/contrast-floor-check.sh
#
# TWO HALVES, NEITHER OF THEM AUTHORED HERE
# -----------------------------------------
# The first half asks THIS BUILD what colour it projects for each low-contrast
# SGR case, at each floor. That is a MEASURED test in
# src/tests/minimum_contrast_tests.zig which paints a real session through
# `grid.paint` and reads the resolved foreground off the display list; this
# script only greps its `CONTRAST-FLOOR` lines.
#
# The second half feeds those colours to scripts/measure-cell-contrast.m, which
# `#include`s the PINNED SDK's own appkit_host.m and inks a terminal row
# through the host's real CoreText rasterizer.
#
# So both columns come out of code that shipped. Flip `minimum-contrast` and
# the whole table moves on its own. This is the rule phux-cockpit-aht was
# merged and retracted for breaking: a "fix" was validated against a
# hand-edited SDK state no build was ever in, and against the commit that
# actually shipped it moved zero pixels.
#
# WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE
# --------------------------
# It proves the rasterizer's response to the colour the projection chose. It is
# NOT a screenshot of the app: it cannot see a layout mistake or a command that
# was never emitted. `zig build test` covers the projection-to-display-list
# wire (including the one through view.zig's real chrome build); this covers
# display-list-to-pixels. See docs/RENDER_FIDELITY.md for why no single
# instrument covers both without the Screen Recording permission.
#
# READING THE NUMBERS
# -------------------
# `solid` and `lit` are absolute luminance thresholds and are BLIND to the
# defect: dark ink on a dark ground is ink that no absolute threshold counts,
# so unreadable text and blank space both score zero. `distinct` (pixels more
# than one 8-bit step from the row's own background) and `peak_delta` are the
# statistics that separate them, and they are what to read here.
