#
# This is the evidence behind scripts/dev-run.sh. Reasoning about bundle
# identity is exactly the kind of argument that sounds complete and is not: the
# packaged bundle carries the SAME CFBundleIdentifier and the SAME executable
# name as the installed app, and three days of bug reports went to the wrong
# binary while everyone involved believed otherwise.
#
# EVERY ASSERTION HERE HAS A NEGATIVE CONTROL, for the reason
# scripts/automate-smoke.sh states at greater length: an assertion never seen to
# fail is not evidence, it is decoration.
#
#   * The identity comparison is first pointed at the UNSTAGED packaged bundle,
#     where it must report a CLASH on all three fields. Only then is it pointed
#     at the staged one, where it must report none. The same comparison,
#     distinguishing the two states.
#   * The config isolation run is paired with a run that removes ONLY the
#     PHUX_COCKPIT_CONFIG/STATE variables, and that run must reach the "real"
#     config. Without that half, "the real config was not touched" is equally
#     consistent with a config file the app never looks at.
#
# NOTHING HERE TOUCHES YOUR REAL FILES. The "real user" side of the experiment
# is a fake HOME and a fake XDG_CONFIG_HOME under a scratch directory, so the
# unisolated arm can genuinely reach a real-shaped config without that config
# being yours. Your actual config and workspace state are fingerprinted at the
# start and re-checked at the end, and the run fails if either moved.
#
# SERIAL ONLY (phux-cockpit-2ml.10). It refuses to start if any instance is
# already running: `pgrep -x <name>` returning exactly one pid is half of what
# is being proved, and it cannot mean anything with somebody else's app up.
