#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build this checkout and run it, as a real app, in a way that cannot be
# confused with the Phux Cockpit in /Applications.
#
#   ./scripts/dev-run.sh
#
# That is the whole command. Everything below is optional.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# On 2026-08-12 it surfaced that three days of rendering bug reports had been
# filed against /Applications/Phux Cockpit.app -- version 0.7.1, built
# 2026-08-09 -- while `main` was 0.8.0. Nothing merged in those three days had
# ever been in front of the person reporting the bugs. Both apps are called
# "Phux Cockpit", both put the same icon in the same Dock, and until now the
# only local run was a bare binary out of `zig-out/bin` that shared the
# installed app's bundle identity, its process name, and its state file. There
# was no cheap way to be SURE which one you were looking at, so the expensive
# way -- three days -- happened instead.
#
# This command makes the answer obvious: the dev build's Dock tile and
# application menu read "Phux Cockpit (dev)", its process is `phux-cockpit-dev`
# rather than `phux-cockpit`, and its config, workspace layout and automation
# dropbox live under `.dev-run/` in this repo. Run both at once if you like;
# nothing they own is shared. scripts/lib/dev-app.sh explains the four separate
# mechanisms that takes, and `./scripts/dev-isolation-check.sh` drives both apps
# at once and proves it.
#
# OPTIONS
#   --debug              Debug build instead of ReleaseSafe. Faster to compile,
#                        but it is NOT what ships: scripts/package-macos.sh
#                        builds ReleaseSafe, so timing-shaped questions (frame
#                        pacing, input latency) need the default.
#   --automation         Build with -Dautomation=true and print how to drive it.
#   --config PATH        Use this config file instead of .dev-run/config. The
#                        app WRITES to whatever file it is given (a theme choice
#                        from the settings surface), so naming your real config
#                        here means a dev build can edit it.
#   --fresh              Delete the dev home first: config, workspace layout,
#                        dropbox. A clean first-launch.
#   --detach             Print the pid and exit instead of staying attached.
#   --no-build           Run what is already staged. Skips zig entirely.
#   --phux               -Dphux-enabled=true, with the FFI directories the build
#                        already knows how to find.
#   --measure-first-frame Build with automation, enable the SDK's launch/GPU
#                        phase stamps, bind the first nonblank snapshot to the
#                        launched pid, and fail if its 150ms budget is missed.
#
# The foreground run is the default because it makes quitting unambiguous:
# ctrl-c here ends the app, and closing the app ends this script. A dev build
# you forgot was running is a dev build that will confuse the next launch.
