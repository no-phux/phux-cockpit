# The CHEAP half of the guard ritual, wired into `zig build test`.
#
# A guard is a regression test that has been WATCHED FAILING with its fix
# removed. `scripts/guard-red-run.sh` is what watches; this script is what
# keeps the resulting bookkeeping from rotting, and it is deliberately the
# only half that runs on every gate, because it costs milliseconds and the
# other half costs minutes.
#
# It answers three questions, all of them statically:
#
#   1. Does every `// GUARD: <name>` marker in src/ have a guard file, and
#      does every guard file name a test that still exists with that marker?
#      A marker whose file was deleted is a claim with nothing behind it.
#
#   2. Has every guard actually been demonstrated red? A guard file with no
#      `red:` line is a test-shaped comment — exactly the thing phux-cockpit-2ml.2
#      exists to stop. guard-red-run.sh is the only writer of that line, and it
#      writes it only after watching the named test fail.
#
#   3. Does each guard's break still APPLY to the tree? This is the staleness
#      test. `red:` records a run against a particular shape of the fix; if the
#      fix has since moved, the recorded proof is about code that is gone. A
#      patch that no longer applies is not a failure of the fix — it is a
#      demand to re-derive the guard and watch it go red again.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT check is whether the test would still go red.
# Nothing static can know that. That is what guard-red-run.sh is for, and the
# gap between "the break still applies" and "the test still fails without the
# fix" is real. See docs/GUARDS.md.
#
# Silent on success: this runs as a build step with inherited stdio, and Zig's
# build runner reports any step that wrote to stderr as a failure.

# The guard currently being re-derived, if any, named by guard-red-run.sh.
#
# Checks 2 and 3 are exactly what a re-derivation is on its way to satisfying,
# and this script runs inside the `zig build test` that re-derivation uses as
# its baseline — so without this the mechanism deadlocks the moment a guard
# goes stale: guard-check refuses the tree because the guard is unproved, and
# guard-red-run refuses to prove it because the baseline is not green. It was
# reachable the first time a fix's CONTEXT moved, which is the ordinary life of
# any line of code.
#
# Deliberately narrow: only the guard being re-derived, only the two checks it
# is in the middle of answering. Its marker and its test must still exist, and
# every OTHER guard is held to the full standard.
