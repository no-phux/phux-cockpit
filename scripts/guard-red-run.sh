# The EXPENSIVE half of the guard ritual: remove a fix, watch its test go red,
# put the fix back.
#
# phux-cockpit-2ml.2. On 2026-08-10 a regression test PASSED against the very
# bug it was written to catch. It allowed "a few more frames" to settle, and
# the old one-pane-per-frame behaviour needed exactly four frames for four
# panes - inside the allowance. It was caught only because someone remembered
# to disable the fix by hand and re-run, at which point it was tightened to
# assert EXACTLY ONE viewport dispatch.
#
# That step is the only thing separating a regression test from a test-shaped
# comment, and doing it by memory is doing it sometimes. This script does it on
# demand, records the evidence in the guard file, and refuses to record
# anything it did not watch happen.
#
#   scripts/guard-red-run.sh                        prove every guard
#   scripts/guard-red-run.sh NAME [NAME...]         prove the named guards
#   scripts/guard-red-run.sh --record NAME \
#       --test "the zig test name" [PATH...]        capture the break sitting
#                                                   in the working tree, then
#                                                   prove it
#
# PATH narrows what is captured, and giving it is the safe habit: without it
# the capture is the whole `git diff`, which on a shared checkout has already
# swept up an unrelated build.zig.zon edit that belonged to someone else.
#
# Cost: one full `zig build test` per guard, plus a green baseline. About 40
# seconds each on this machine. This is NOT a gate - it is what you run when
# you add or move a guard. The cheap half that DOES run on every gate is
# scripts/guard-check.sh; see docs/GUARDS.md for the division of labour.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS PROOF, and why the checks are the shape they are:
#
#   * The exit code is necessary and nowhere near sufficient. A break that
#     stops the tree COMPILING also exits non-zero, and proves nothing about
#     the test. So the red run must name the test: Zig prints
#     `error: '<module>.test.<name>' failed:` for a genuine assertion failure
#     and nothing of the sort for a compile error.
#
#   * The green baseline runs FIRST, before anything is touched. A guard
#     "proved" against an already-red tree is proving the wrong thing, and the
#     baseline is also the only run that prints the verdict block - which is
#     where the `source root:` line lives. A build that silently ran in a
#     sibling worktree has happened here; the exit code was real and the tree
#     was not.
#
#   * The recorded evidence names the HEAD it was proved at, and the run
#     re-reads that HEAD at the end. A checkout that moved underneath the run
#     invalidates the whole thing, and on a shared working directory that is
#     not hypothetical - it happened while this script was being written.
#
#   * The break is a git patch, applied and reverse-applied. Never a hand-edit
#     performed here and compared against a state no build was ever in. See the
#     retraction recorded in scripts/host-raster-compare.sh for what that costs.
