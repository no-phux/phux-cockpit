#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# phux-cockpit-2ml.10. Live-app automation on this repo is serial-only, and
# both ways it goes wrong are SILENT - they do not produce an error, they
# produce a clean transcript about the wrong process.
#
#   1. ACTIVATION IS GLOBAL AND NAME-BASED. The only reliable way to front
#      this app is System Events (`tell application "Phux Cockpit" to
#      activate` does NOT reliably work for a bundle launched by its inner
#      binary), and System Events targets a process BY NAME. With two
#      instances live, `process "phux-cockpit"` resolves to an arbitrary one,
#      so a test needing OS focus measures a window it never launched and says
#      nothing about it.
#
#   2. INSTANCE CONFUSION IS NOT REPORTED. On 2026-08-12 one instance logged
#      `event=stop` and `window_closed` mid-sequence while a DIFFERENT pid
#      kept answering the dropbox. The snapshot came back with a `ready=true`
#      header and ZERO widget lines. Nothing failed. A test reads that as "the
#      UI vanished" - a product bug - when it actually means "you are talking
#      to a corpse". That is worse than a crash: it manufactures a finding.
#
# So the guard is three separate refusals, because they have three different
# causes and a reader who sees the wrong one goes looking in the wrong place:
# a second instance is live; the dropbox publisher is not our pid; the tree is
# empty. Each prints what it saw and what to do about it.
#
# WHY A SHARED FILE AND NOT A COPY PER SCRIPT
# --------------------------------------------
# There were three copies before this file, and they had already drifted:
# drive-shell-ceiling.sh and drive-backing-scale.sh each refused a
# pre-existing instance and each asserted publisher_pid ONCE at startup;
# automate-smoke.sh - the script most likely to be run by hand, mid-swarm -
# did neither. None of the three could catch the mid-sequence swap in (2),
# because none of them looked again after the first assertion. One definition
# means the next script gets the guard by sourcing it rather than by
# remembering to reimplement it.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
# ---------------------
# It does not make concurrent runs work. The automation dropbox is per-user,
# not per-process: a second bundle steals the channel no matter how carefully
# each side checks. This turns a silent wrong answer into a refusal, which is
# the whole of the available fix short of a per-instance dropbox.
#
# A locally built app run through scripts/dev-run.sh takes the process name
# `phux-cockpit-dev`, which removes the dev-versus-installed collision by
# construction (phux-cockpit-g2x). It does NOT remove the case this guard is
# for - two agents each driving their own bundle, both named `phux-cockpit`.
# Set PHUX_COCKPIT_PROCESS_NAME to point the guard at a differently-named
# build; the default is what `zig build package` produces.

# The executable name `pgrep -x` and System Events both match on. Overridable
# for a build staged under another identity (scripts/dev-run.sh).
APP_INSTANCE_NAME="${PHUX_COCKPIT_PROCESS_NAME:-phux-cockpit}"

# Set by app_instance_bind. Read by every guarded call after it.
APP_INSTANCE_PID=""
APP_INSTANCE_NATIVE=""

# Every live pid carrying our process name, one per line, newest last.
#
# `pgrep -x` and not `pgrep -f`: `-f` matches against the whole command line,
# which includes the command line of the shell running the pgrep itself, so it
# self-matches and reports a hit every single time. That is not a hypothetical
# - it is why a wait loop written with `-f` can never exit. `-x` matches the
# executable name, which cannot self-match from a shell.

# the corpse transcript from the bead - without needing to reproduce the race
