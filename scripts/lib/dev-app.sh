# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# Shared machinery for running a LOCALLY BUILT Cockpit that macOS, your eyes,
# and every name-based automation script can tell apart from the copy in
# /Applications. Source it, do not run it:
#
#   ROOT="$(CDPATH='' cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
#   . "${ROOT}/scripts/lib/dev-app.sh"
#
# "Does not clash" is not one property. It is four, each with its own mechanism,
# and getting three of them right still leaves a build you can mistake for the
# installed app.
#
# 1. BUNDLE IDENTITY. `zig build package` stamps app.zon's `.id` into
#    CFBundleIdentifier, so a local build carries the SAME identity as the
#    shipped app -- dev.phux.cockpit, verbatim, verified by
#    `plutil -p zig-out/package/phux-cockpit.app/Contents/Info.plist`.
#    LaunchServices, the Dock, the app switcher and `open -b` all key off that
#    string, so to macOS the two are one app wearing two paths. The SDK offers
#    no build option for it (`grep 'b.option' build.zig` in the pinned SDK lists
#    platform, trace, automation, web-engine, cef, signing -- no bundle id), so
#    `dev_app_stage` rewrites the packaged bundle's plist afterwards: `<id>.dev`,
#    and a bundle name the Dock tile and application menu show as
#    "Phux Cockpit (dev)".
#
# 2. PROCESS NAME. This is the one that bites tooling rather than eyes, and it
#    is invisible until it has already lied to you. `pgrep -x phux-cockpit` and
#    `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to ... process
#    "phux-cockpit"'` both target BY NAME, and that name is the executable
#    file's name inside Contents/MacOS. Two live instances sharing it means
#    activation, screenshots and key delivery land on an arbitrary one and
#    nothing reports the substitution -- see phux-cockpit-2ml.10.
#    `dev_app_stage` renames the executable to `phux-cockpit-dev` and points
#    CFBundleExecutable at it, which moves both `pgrep -x` and System Events.
#
# 3. CONFIG AND STATE. `PHUX_COCKPIT_CONFIG` and `PHUX_COCKPIT_STATE` each name
#    a FILE and win outright over every search path, for writes as well as reads
#    (src/main.zig `loadUserConfig`, `resolveStatePath`). Setting both is what
#    keeps a dev build from restoring -- and then overwriting -- the workspace
#    the installed app was about to open, and from writing a theme change back
#    into the config file you actually use. Note that leaving them unset does
#    NOT fall back to something harmless: the dotfile lookup reads
#    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME first, which is set on this machine, so an "isolated by
#    HOME" run still finds your real config.
#
# 4. THE AUTOMATION DROPBOX. It has no environment seam at all: the app opens
#    `.zig-cache/native-sdk-automation` relative to its CURRENT WORKING
#    DIRECTORY (pinned SDK, src/app_runner/root.zig, `automation.Server.init`),
#    and the CLI resolves the same relative path from wherever you run it. The
#    only way to give a run its own dropbox is to launch it from its own
#    directory, which is why `dev_app_launch` chdirs rather than exporting.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. Two paths stay shared with the installed app, because the
# SDK keys them off the bundle id COMPILED IN from app.zon rather than the one
# in the plist: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.phux.cockpit/State/windows.zon`
# and `~/Library/Logs/dev.phux.cockpit/native-sdk.jsonl` (observed by running a
# staged bundle under a scratch HOME and listing what appeared). Nothing reads
# windows.zon back -- app.zon sets `restore_state = false` on the main window --
# so the cost today is a shared log file and a window frame nobody restores.
# Isolating them would take an app.zon change or an SDK option that does not
# exist.
#
# RELATED: scripts/lib/measure.sh grew a `measure_launch_isolated` for the
# measurement harness. It covers point 3 only. Once both have landed they should
# share one launcher; see the follow-up bead.

    # that was never true and so could never fail for our reason. What must hold
