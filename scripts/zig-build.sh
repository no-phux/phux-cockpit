# `zig build` with a per-worktree Zig global cache, an orphan reaper, and a
# refusal to build a tree you are not standing in. See phux-cockpit-2ml.11.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL
#
# Zig's global cache (`~/.cache/zig` by default) is shared by every checkout on
# the machine, and a cache entry is guarded by an EXCLUSIVE advisory lock on its
# manifest file in `<global cache>/h/<hash>.txt`. The lock is held for the whole
# time the entry is being produced. That is correct for one user and one
# checkout: the second build waits a moment and then gets the first build's
# work for free.
#
# With one worktree per agent it stops being correct. The manifests that land in
# the global cache are project-independent -- a hello-world and this repo were
# measured writing the SAME manifest, h/19941dd10bf085611a6d575c4f038f22.txt --
# so every worktree on this machine queues on the same file. A build runner that
# outlives its session holds that lock forever, and every other worktree stops.
# That is the 30-minute starvation recorded on the bead, and it was reproduced
# here deliberately:
#
#   held lock + shared global cache   -> blocked, killed at 45s (exit 124)
#   held lock + isolated global cache -> exit 0 in 3s
#   lock released + shared cache      -> exit 0 in 1s
#
# (scripts/zig-cache-isolation-check.sh runs that A/B on demand.)
#
# WHAT IS ISOLATED AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT
#
# Isolating the whole global cache per worktree would be the easy answer and the
# wrong one: `p/` is the package cache, and re-fetching the pinned SDK and
# ghostty per worktree costs a network round trip that an offline machine simply
# cannot make. Measured on this repo, `zig build --fetch=all` into a brand-new
# worktree:
#
#   fully private global cache   16s, 172 MB downloaded
#   private cache, shared `p/`    7s, 0 bytes downloaded
#
# So `p/` is shared by symlink and everything else (b/ h/ o/ z/ tmp/) is private.
# Sharing `p/` is safe in a way sharing the rest is not: its entries are
# immutable, content-addressed and hash-verified, written once by an atomic
# rename out of `tmp/`, and never rewritten. Nothing in it is produced under a
# long-held lock, so it cannot starve anybody.
#
# The private half is cheap because Zig 0.16 already materializes dependency
# SOURCE into a build-root-relative `zig-pkg/` (528-693 MB, per worktree,
# already). What is left in the global cache for a full `zig build test` here is
# 45 MB, of which the only substantial artifact is one `libcompiler_rt.a`:
#
#   du -sh <private global cache>/*  ->  b 28K   h 132K   o 3.1M   z 41M
#
# ORPHANS
#
# The other half of the damage: build runners outliving their session. A real
# one was found while writing this -- pid 65004, ppid 1, 73 minutes old, still
# spinning a test binary in a worktree whose session was long gone. Nothing was
# going to read its exit code. This script kills orphaned runners for ITS OWN
# build root before starting, never for anybody else's, and puts its own zig in
# a process group it tears down on exit so it does not become the next one.
