# Regression check for scripts/zig-build.sh -- the per-worktree Zig global
# cache, the wrong-tree refusal, and the orphan reaper. See phux-cockpit-2ml.11.
#
# Every assertion here carries its own negative control, because this repo has
# already merged and then publicly retracted a finding that rested on an
# assertion nobody had watched fail. So each check either disables the fix and
# watches the check go RED, or asserts the absent state before acting. A check
# that has only ever been seen green is not evidence that anything works.
#
# The centrepiece is CONTENTION. It reproduces the starvation the bead records,
# with a lock deliberately held on a shared global cache manifest:
#
#   shared global cache, lock held    -> the build blocks until the watchdog
#   isolated global cache, lock held  -> the build finishes in seconds
#   shared global cache, lock released-> the build finishes in seconds
#
# The third case is what makes the first two mean something: it shows the lock,
# not the cache path, was the difference.
#
# Runtime is about a minute, most of it the deliberate block. Not wired into
# `zig build test`: it takes over a global cache manifest and spawns a fake
# orphan, neither of which belongs in a run somebody is waiting on.
