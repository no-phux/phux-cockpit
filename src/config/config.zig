/// comments, their spacing, their ordering, and every key this build has never
/// heard of are all THEIRS, and an app that rewrites a person's file by
/// serializing its own parsed model back out would silently delete all of it —
/// including keys a NEWER build understands and this one does not. So the file
/// is edited as TEXT: every byte that is not the one line being set is copied
/// through verbatim, line terminators included.
///
/// The two things it does change, and why:
///
///   * a matching key's line is REPLACED IN PLACE, so the setting keeps the
///     position in the file its author gave it;
///   * a SECOND and later line naming the same key is DROPPED. The parser is
///     last-wins, so leaving a later duplicate would mean this function
///     returned successfully and the setting still did not take effect — a
///     silent no-op, which is the exact failure this whole round exists to
///     end. A duplicate key is already a bug in the file; collapsing it to the
///     one line that now holds the value is the honest repair.
///
/// A key that appears nowhere is APPENDED, with a newline first when the file
/// does not already end in one. Nothing else is added — no banner, no
/// "written by" comment, no reordering.
///
/// Comment lines are matched by the same rule the parser uses (`stripComment`:
/// a `#` in the first non-blank column), so a commented-out `# theme = nord`
/// is left exactly where it is and the live key is added separately. That is
