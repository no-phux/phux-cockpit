//! One libghostty emulator session and its canvas-grid projection.
//!
//! libghostty-vt owns cell state, damage, scrollback, and selection. This
//! module owns the session and PROJECTS its viewport into a
//! `canvas.TerminalGrid` (see `Session.snapshot`), which
//! `canvas.terminal_grid.paint` turns into pixels. The palette is
//! theme-derived where the emulator still holds its defaults (the honest
//! ANSI-16 story) and exact everywhere an application chose a color: the
//! 256-color cube, the grayscale ramp, and truecolor pass through
//! untouched.
//!
//! It used to emit canvas commands itself — run merging, per-row ids,
//! glyph and text accounting, box-drawing geometry, roughly 375 lines of
//! it. All of that is the framework's now. What stays here is the local
//! provider's libghostty session and its byte-injection path. The framework's
//! own session store (`runtime/terminal_session.zig`) is capped at four ptys and
//! has no inbound byte-injection path. Other providers project their
//! authoritative model straight into the shared painter below.
