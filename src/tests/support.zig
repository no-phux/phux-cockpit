// --------------------------------------------------------- cell grids
//
// A terminal screen paints as `cell_grid` commands: a packed cols x rows
// lattice of 20-byte cells, each carrying its own background, cluster
// (an offset into the grid's interned byte pool), foreground, underline
// colour, and style bits. Every renderer expands the lattice itself.
//
// The painter emits ONE `cell_grid` command PER ROW, not one per screen.
// That is deliberate: a retained command is the unit of incremental
// change, so a screen-wide lattice made every keystroke re-encode and
// re-upload every cell (the SDK measured 31 upserts and 8.4 KB per
// keystroke against 1 upsert and ~400 bytes once rows became their own
// commands). A row command therefore carries `rows == 1`, its own
// `origin.y`, and its own interned text blob.
//
// What that means for a TEST:
//   - There are no per-run `fill_rect` / `draw_text` commands for
//     terminal CONTENT any more, so a test that wants to know what
//     reached the glass reads CELLS.
//   - A screen costs roughly ONE COMMAND PER PAINTED ROW plus a small
//     fixed prologue/epilogue (surface fill, clip push, cursor, caret,
//     scrollbar thumb, clip pop) — NOT a constant, and not a function of
//     how dense the content is either. The only content that still
//     prices in commands is what the lattice deliberately cannot carry:
//     box-drawing geometry at exact cell bounds, and the selection wash.
//   - "How much painted" is therefore painted ROWS and inked CELLS.
//
// Everything below is that one seam: `CellGridView` puts the SCREEN back
// together from a pane's row commands, so every accessor keeps meaning
// what it always meant (`rows()` is the pane's painted height, `at(x, y)`
// addresses the whole screen with y = 0 at the top). No test decodes a
// cell, or a row command, by hand.

/// A whole terminal SCREEN, aggregated from the per-row `cell_grid`
/// commands that share one pane's command-id namespace.
///
/// Deliberately SMALL (a slice plus a namespace, 24 bytes): this is
/// returned BY VALUE from the finders below, and a debug build
/// materialises a returned aggregate in the caller's frame for the rest
/// of that function. An inline array of 96 `CellGrid`s here would put
/// ~9 KB on every fixture's frame — and this repo has already been
